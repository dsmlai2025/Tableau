# Job Market Analysis

In this Project, I analyze a job posting dataset for a fictional recruitment company. 
Use visualization techniques to identify the most in-demand skills for data scientists, analysts, and engineers.

Begin by importing and cleaning the data, then create filters and calculated fields to uncover trends through visualizations.
Finally, build interactive dashboards in Tableau to present your insights and answer the teamâ€™s key questions.
