# HR Analytics Dashboard Using Tableau

## Project Overview
The HR Analytics Dashboard project leverages Tableau to visualize and analyze key human resource metrics, enabling data-driven decision making. It provides comprehensive insights into employee turnover, recruitment, performance, and engagement to support strategic HR initiatives.

## Tools Used

### Data Cleaning Steps

* Raw HR data was cleaned by handling missing values, standardizing formats, and validating records to ensure accuracy. This preprocessing step was crucial for reliable analysis and included filtering irrelevant data and transforming data types to align with dashboard requirements.

## Dashboard Overview

* The dashboard features interactive visualizations of HR metrics such as turnover rates, headcount, recruitment efficiency, and employee performance. Users can filter data by department, location, or job level, allowing deep dives into workforce trends and actionable insights to enhance HR management.

### Actionable Insights

* Identify departments or locations with high employee turnover rates to focus retention efforts and reduce attrition costs.
    
* Measure job satisfaction across job roles using survey scores or feedback metrics segmented by role to identify areas of low satisfaction and target improvements.

### Recommendations

* Implement targeted employee engagement and development programs in areas showing low engagement or performance scores. For example, introduce comprehensive wellness initiatives such as mindfulness workshops and fitness challenges to support well-being; establish continuous learning opportunities like mentorship programs and personalized training; foster a culture of recognition through peer-to-peer rewards and public acknowledgments; and encourage team bonding and innovation with regular team-building activities and cross-departmental collaboration sessions to boost motivation, satisfaction, and productivity.

* Use interactive dashboard filters to regularly review workforce metrics by segment—such as department, location, job role, or tenure—enabling tailored HR interventions and continuous improvement. For instance, HR managers can quickly identify teams with rising absenteeism or low engagement scores, then drill down to investigate root causes and deploy targeted retention programs. Interactive dashboards also allow monitoring recruitment KPIs like time-to-fill and cost-per-hire, empowering data-driven adjustments to hiring strategies and workforce planning.
