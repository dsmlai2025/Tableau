# Movies Dashboard Using Tableau

## Project Overview
* The Netflix Movie Dashboard project visualizes diverse data from Netflix's movie and TV show catalog to provide insights on content distribution, genre popularity, ratings, and temporal trends. It enables users to explore movies by country, analyze the top 10 genres, and observe release patterns over the years, delivering a comprehensive view of Netflix's content landscape.

## Tools Used

### Data Cleaning Steps

* Data cleaning involved handling missing or inconsistent entries for attributes such as country, genre, and ratings. Duplicate records were removed, data types standardized, and categorical values normalized for uniformity. This ensured reliable aggregation and filtering in the dashboard visualizations.

## Dashboard Overview

* The dashboard presents key visualizations including a geographical distribution map of movies by country, a ranked bar chart of the top 10 genres, and rating distributions for different movie and TV show titles. Additional charts depict the number of movies and shows released by year, allowing users to track growth and trends interactively through filter controls.

* Ratings distribution reveals that certain genres and series consistently achieve higher viewer satisfaction, while other categories show opportunities for quality improvement.

 * Geographical analysis confirms the United States, India, and the UK as leading content production hubs, but emerging markets show growth potential in localized content offerings.

### Recommendations

* Expand investment in high-performing genres identified through ratings data and regional preferences to maximize viewer engagement and retention.

* Increase focus on content production in emerging regions with rising audiences to capture untapped markets and promote diverse storytelling.

* Monitor content release patterns continuously to balance catalog freshness with viewer demand, optimizing future content acquisition and production schedules.
